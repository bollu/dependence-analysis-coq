* Polyhedral Compilation
* Formal Verification
- Have proofs of compiler correctness
- Involve semantic preservation between source and target language
- Use a theorem prover to encode proofs

* Coq
- Three-puns: 
-- Thierry Coquand.
-- Calculus of Constructions (CoC).
-- Tradition of naming tools after animals: "rooster".

- Built on a theory of the Calculus of Constructions.
- Write programs, prove propositions about given program.
- Demo

* CompCert


* VE-LLVM
* Future directions
